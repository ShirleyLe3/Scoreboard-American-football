# American Football Scoreboard


### Description

In this project, you build an app that displays a scoreboard for an American football game. There will be two buttons for each team - one will increment that team's score by three points (for a "field goal") and the other will increment that team's score by seven points (for a "touchdown" and "extra point"). The css is already done for you. You should focus your efforts on the functionality of the app.

## Project Set Up

- [ ] CD into the project base directory `cd scoreboard-american-football`
- [ ] Download project dependencies by running `npm install`
- [ ] Start up the app using `npm start`
